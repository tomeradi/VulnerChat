# Leaky Chat

A vulnerable and leaky chat application used for security demos.

## History

The need arise quite often to demonstrate the value of various security controls in a "real world" environment. Since most exploits are relatively complex and not visually compelling, a better method of showing security challenges was needed.

I wrote this [node.js](https://nodejs.org) chat application with the express intention of leaving some vulnerabilities exposed.

**Please do not use this in production, it's not a real chat application!**

A chat application is very easy to pull together in node and it's a great platform to illustrate these security challenges. I started with [this great tutorial](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) from Socket.IO and kept iterating new features as needed.
